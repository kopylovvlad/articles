Coursera is one of the best online education platform and recently I have finished first course on it.

It was new great experience for me. I choose course “English for Business and Entrepreneurship” by University of Pennsylvania. And this is my short review.

**Course title**: English for Business and Entrepreneurship
**University**: University of Pennsylvania
**Instructors**: Amy Nichols and James Riedel
**Weeks amount**: 5

## Review:

It is great and interesting course for non-native English speakers. At this course you will learn about business economy. Course have video lectures, tests, cases and homework. You will learn:

- What different between entrepreneur and business-owner
- How to write survey
- Why and how to write business plan
- Why we need a financials plan

- How to pitch

Course have 2 very interesting assessments: “Your Survey and Result” and “Written Business Plan”.

Summary: 4/5. Course is great but I want more.
