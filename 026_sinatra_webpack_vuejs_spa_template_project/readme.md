# Sinatra Webpack Vue.js SPA Template Project

![image01](image01.png)

Vue.js becomes more and more popular. Everyone web-developer had tried write SPA application with Vue.js (or react ðŸ˜€). Also, [GitLab made the decision to use Vue.js](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/). And I learned Vue.js and use it in my job. I really donâ€™t like front-end, but Vue.js did it more friendly for me.

Like every ruby-developer, I like RoR. Since RoR v.5.1.0, we have compilation tools like Yarn and Webpack and can use js-ecosystem. But someone prefers Sinatra to Rails. After few days of an experiment, I wrote a repository on GitHub with Sinatra Webpack vue.js SPA template project. It has started Webpack config and simple single-page application (TODO list).

And now, anyone can get started immediately and use it for creating own application: [GitHub link](https://github.com/kopylovvlad/sinatra-webpack-vuejs-template)
