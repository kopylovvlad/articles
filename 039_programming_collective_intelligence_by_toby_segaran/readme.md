# Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran

![image01](image01.jpeg)

It is an excellent book for beginners to try machine learning and statistics. While reading the book, you will be programming some machine learning algorithm from scratch (Bayes, k-nn, decision tree and others). The book has a lot of code snippets and little amount of math formulas.

I recommend the book if you are interested in machine learning and statistics. It will be a great intro.
